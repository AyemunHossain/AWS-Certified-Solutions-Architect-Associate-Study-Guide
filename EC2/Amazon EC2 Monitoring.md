# Automated monitoring tools include:

* System Status Checks – monitor the AWS systems required to use your instance to ensure they are working properly. These checks detect problems with your instance that require AWS involvement to repair.
* Instance Status Checks – monitor the software and network configuration of your individual instance. These checks detect problems that require your involvement to repair.
* Amazon CloudWatch Alarms – watch a single metric over a time period you specify, and perform one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods.
* Amazon CloudWatch Events – automate your AWS services and respond automatically to system events.
* Amazon CloudWatch Logs – monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon EC2 instances, AWS CloudTrail, or other sources.


# Amazon EC2 Monitoring:
* Monitor your EC2 instances with CloudWatch. By default, EC2 sends metric data to CloudWatch in 5-minute periods.
* You can also enable detailed monitoring to collect data in 1-minute periods.
