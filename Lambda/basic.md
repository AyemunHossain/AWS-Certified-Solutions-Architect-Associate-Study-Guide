# AWS Lambda Overview

## Serverless Compute Service
AWS Lambda is a fully managed **serverless compute service** that executes code in response to events.

### Key Features:
- **On-Demand Execution:** Executes your code only when needed and scales automatically.  
- **Stateless Functions:** No affinity to the underlying infrastructure.  
- **Resource Allocation:** You choose the memory allocation, and AWS Lambda provides proportional **CPU power, network bandwidth, and disk I/O**.  
- **Compliance:** AWS Lambda is **SOC, HIPAA, PCI, ISO** compliant.  


### Components of a Lambda Application
1. **Function:** The code you want to execute.
2. **Execution environment:** Aisolated micro virtual machine where a Lambda function is executed.
3. **Runtimes:** The programming languages supported by AWS Lambda.
4. **Environment variables:** Key-value pairs that you can pass to your Lambda function.
5. **Event source:** The trigger that invokes your Lambda function.
6. **Downstream resources:** The services that your Lambda function interacts with.
7. **Logging and monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.

### Lambda Function
- You can upload your application code as a ZIP file or a container image hosted on Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR).
- Versions â€“ a snapshot of your functionâ€™s state at a given time. When you publish a new version, a :version-number is appended to your functionâ€™s ARN:

### Invoking Lambda Functions
- Lambda supports synchronous and asynchronous invocation of a Lambda function.

    - **Synchronous invocation:** 
        - When a function is invoked synchronously, AWS Lambda waits until the function is done processing, then returns the result.
        - Can accept a payload of up to 6 MB.

    - **Asynchronous invocation:** 
        - When a function is invoked asynchronously, AWS Lambda stores the event in an internal queue and handles the invocation later.
        - The Lambda function returns a 202 status code (Accepted) immediately after being invoked.
        - Can only accept a payload of up to 256 KB.

### Event Source Mapping
- A Lambda resource that reads from a queue or stream and synchronously invokes a Lambda function.
- You can apply an event-filtering pattern to process events that are only relevant to your application. This allows you to save money by reducing the number of function invocations.

### Concurrency Management
- **Concurrency:** The number of requests that your function is serving at any given time.
- **Reserve concurrency:** The maximum number of concurrent requests that your function can serve.
- **Provisioned concurrency:** Pre-initialized execution environments that reduce the functionâ€™s cold start time.

### Lambda Function URL
- You can invoke a Lambda function using an HTTP request.
- The URL is generated by the API Gateway service.

### Configuring a Lambda Function to Access Resources in a VPC
- You can configure a Lambda function to access resources in a VPC.
- This allows you to access resources in a private subnet without exposing them to the public internet.

### Lambda@Edge
- Lambda@Edge allows you to run Lambda functions at AWS edge locations.
- You can use Lambda@Edge to customize the content delivered by Amazon CloudFront.


## Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch
- Once your Lambda function is in production, **AWS Lambda automatically monitors** its performance.  
- Reports key metrics through **Amazon CloudWatch** for tracking and optimization.
