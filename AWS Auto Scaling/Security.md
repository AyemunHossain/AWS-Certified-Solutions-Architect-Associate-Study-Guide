### AWS Auto Scaling Security
- [AWS Auto Scaling Security](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/security/)

- Use IAM to help secure your resources by controlling who can perform AWS Auto Scaling actions.
- By default, a brand new IAM user has NO permissions to do anything. To grant permissions to call Auto Scaling actions, you attach an IAM policy to the IAM users or groups that require the permissions it grants.
